Welcome! This is a website about **Cindy**. This is me.  
<img src="images/photo.jpg" style="width:50%">

I'm an MD graduate currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. I have a passion for **aerospace medicine** and extreme environment medicine, and I am interested in integrating AI and machine learning into medical practices to advance healthcare. Outside the academics, I enjoy climbing, scuba diving, and exploring the great outdoors, embracing the challenges and adventures that life has to offer.

If you'd like to learn more about my professional and academic experiences, go to [this page](about.html).
